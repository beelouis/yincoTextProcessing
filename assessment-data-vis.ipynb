    "You should submit all the code that you will write for this assessment, and all your code should be located in one Jupyter Notebook. You can extend the notebooks that are provided by the module team. Your submission should be clearly labelled at the top of your file with your name, your Kent login, and your Kent ID. You should include any data that you will create for this assessment (e.g. the books that you will download from the Gutenberg project). All the output generated by your programs should be embedded in your Jupyter Notebook whenever possible. All the external files generated by your code must be included as well. For example, if you have to save any plots in external files, include all those files. The marking team will read your notebooks in the first instance with the output that you will provide, but they will also run your code on their machines. For this reason, you should submit all the files that are required to compile all your code.\n",

    "1. A clear structure of the document with dedicated sections for every question; show clearly where one question ends and where the next question begins\n",

    "4. Both the `ipynb` and HTML versions of your notebook are submitted\n",
    "5. Your notebook is submitted with all the outputs (i.e. notebook's outputs are not cleared before submission)\n",
    "6. All the outputs generated by your code should be embedded in your Jupyter Notebook document whenever possible. If external files are necessary (we know that the scattertext in Question 4 will be an external HTML file), such external files should be accessible via URLs embedded in your notebook. To add a URL to your Jupyter Notebook, you can simply type: `[blue_text](url_here)`. Example URLs are shown in the `scattertext.jpynb` file that is located in the current folder."

    "1. Read the <code>scattertext.ipynb</code> notebook. Execute it, and analyse the two HTML files that it produces (spoken_fiction.html and two_books_scattertext.html). The second one is large, and it may take a few seconds to load in your web browser.\n",

This file contains the term frequencies computed for two books: \"Bothers Karamazov\" and \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\". Both books were downloaded in the TXT format from the Gutenberg project. The first column in the file contains the word/term, the second column contains the frequency of the words in the first book, and the third column the frequency of the words in the second book. Your task is to create a similar file for two books of your choice, and then to use the <code>scattertext.ipynb</code> programme to generate a scatterplot. Note that you won't need to change anything in <code>scattertext.ipynb</code>, except for the name of your file with term frequencies (assuming that your file is not named <code>logs/frequencies.csv</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    " Firstly, go to https://www.gutenberg.org - this is a repository for out-of-copyright books - and download two books. You may want to pick two that are somehow related. For example, the two used in my example have a murder case. You need the Plain Text UTF-8 file of these books.\n",
    "\n",
    " Having the two books of your choice, you will write a Python program that will read both books, and will produce a file similar to <code>logs/frequencies.csv</code> with appropriate frequencies. The <code>cmp_term_frequencies_stud.ipynb</code> shows how you can start the process of extracting frequencies. This is the first part of my program that I used to generate frequencies for \"Bothers Karamazov\" and \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\". You are encouraged to extend this program.\n",

    "   - The original books downloaded from https://www.gutenberg.org\n",
    "   - The file with term frequencies that your program will generate\n",
    "   - The code that will compute and save the term frequencies to the `CSV` file. This code should appear in your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "   - The HTML files with the scattertext plots generated by the <code>scattertext.ipynb</code> notebook when it is executed on your term-frequency file\n",
    "   - All the data/output files submitted for this question should be accessible via URLs placed in your main Jupyter Notebook. Note that `scattertext.ipynb` shows how to create URLs.\n",
